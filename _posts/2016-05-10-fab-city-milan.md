[Design Now](http://design-now.org/) is a broad-framework program of open collective activities organized by [Politecnico di Milano’s School of Design](http://www.polimi.it/en/) and [POLI.design Consortium](http://www.polidesign.net/en) with the support of [Polifactory](http://www.polifactory.com/), Politecnico di Milano’s makerspace, in partnership with [Triennale di Milano](http://www.triennale.org/en/). This program aligns with the comeback of the Triennale di Milano International Exhibition, after 20 years. “Design Now” focuses on concrete experimentation in one of the main themes of the XXI Triennale: the mutation generated by technological advance and social change in the processes and know-how applied to the ideation and production of contemporary artefacts.

The program of “Design Now” includes:

>**[JAM](http://design-now.org/jam/)** _“When Production goes into the city”_ focused on the relationship between service design and new production-distribution models, in collaboration with [PACO design](http://www.pacollaborative.com/);

>**[Summer School](http://design-now.org/summer-school/)** _“Fab City: Designing Products and Services for Urban Resilience through Manufacturing”_, which will focus on selecting ideas and innovative experiences relating to urban resilience+manufacturing, in collaboration with [IAAC](http://iaac.net/) and [Fab City](http://fab.city/);

>**Exhibition** in September included in the XXI Triennale’s program that will show all the process.


The main principles of designing in and for a Fab City are:
1. Design for liquid times
2. Design products with an urban strategy
3. Design interventions for constructive activism

The [Summer School](http://design-now.org/summer-school/) will take place from the 8th to the 16th of July and it will try to address big questions relating to the future vision of cities, based on three main approaches:

1. Urban Data  
2. Urban Strategies  
3. Urban Models  

The program includes some visits in Milan, to its Fab Labs and Makerspaces, and some lectures. However, the majority of the time will be dedicated to designing products, services or product-service systems for FAB Cities, for urban manufacturing, and public and commercial services.

The [international call](http://design-now.org/application-form/) for application is open and will close on May 26th.
