Beyond Building Barcelona 2015 was the largest reunion of the construction sector and associated industries in Spain, Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Latin America. The [Pavilion of Innovation 2015](http://beyond.iaac.net/?page_id=1605) in Beyond Building Barcelona, curated by [IaaC Fab Lab Barcelona](http://fablabbcn.org/), presented new ideas and construction paradigms emerging from international excellence in research and pilot projects, forming the basis of future buildings and cities.

The video was projected in 4 large screens throughout the whole pavilion.
