A ‘FabCity Campus’ has been set up as part of [Europe by People](http://europebypeople.nl/), the Amsterdam EU2016 Arts & Design programme and it is inspired by the ‘Fab City’ project that started in Barcelona two years ago.

Following the [FAB City](http://fab.city) project, in early April 2016 a temporary, a freely accessible Fab City Campus has been built at the head of Amsterdam’s Java Island in the city’s Eastern Harbour District. Conceived as a green, self-sustaining city, the FabCity Campus will comprise some 50 innovative pavilions, installations and prototypes. More than 400 young students, professionals, artists and creatives will develop the site into a sustainable urban area, where they will work, create, explore and present their solutions to current urban issues. The participants are from various educational backgrounds, including art academies, (technology) universities and vocational colleges. Amsterdam is one of the next candidate cities which will join the FAB City initiative in the following years.

_**Nowadays cities are where most of the planet’s population live, they offer the best opportunity to effect practical change at scale in a context to which people can relate. Cities are at the heart of addressing the social and environmental challenges of the 21st century.**_

FAB City project comprises an international think tank of civic leaders, fab lab champions, makers, urbanists and innovators working on changing paradigm of the current industrial economy where the city operates on a linear model of importing products and producing waste. The [Fab City Expert Meeting](http://europebypeople.nl/programme/fabcity-summit-2) is gathering world leaders on digital fabrication, innovation and urban design in order to look on future models of operations and research for the Fab City project. It will be organised in participatory sessions in which the best skills and knowledge from participants will be oriented towards a common direction of efforts in order to transform the way we work, live and play in cities. We aim to end up with a road map in order to look for funding and organisation opportunities for the future of Fab Cities.
The Expert Meeting is accessible only by invite.

In the evening of April 20th a [public dialogue](http://europebypeople.nl/programme/fabcity-summit) follows the Expert Meeting of the International Fab City network. Many of these participants will also join the discussion: *how can we make a Fab City?*

FAB City Campus will take place from 11 April up and until 26 June. It will be inhabited by students, scientists and (social) entrepreneurs, and will also function as a big maker space; a place to collectively experiment, prototype and test new ways of creating an improved future urban environment. Fab City continues from April until the end of June and will consist of several pavilions showing different innovative ideas for the connected, self-sufficient and circular city, among which the cardboard [Wikkelhouse by Fiction Factory](http://www.fictionfactory.nl/home.php?p=whouse) and the [BAM 3D concrete printer](https://citiesintransition.eu/publicatie/bam-3d-concrete-printer-at-fabcity-campus).
